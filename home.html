                Beer is the oldest and most widely consumed type of alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most
                popular drink overall after potable water and tea. It is produced by the brewing and fermentation of
                starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly from malted barley, although wheat, maize
                (corn), rice, and oats are also used.

                Jägermeister is a German digestif made with 56 herbs and spices. Developed in 1934 by Wilhelm and Curt
                Mast, it has an alcohol by volume of 35% . The recipe has not changed since its creation and continues
                to be served in its signature green glass bottle. It is the flagship product of Mast-Jägermeister SE
                headquartered in Wolfenbüttel, Germany.

                The red volcanic soils in the region of Tequila are well suited for growing the blue agave, and more
                than 300 million of the plants are harvested there each year. Agave grows differently depending on the
                region. Blue agaves grown in the highlands Los Altos region are larger and sweeter in aroma and taste.
                Agaves harvested in the valley region have a more herbaceous fragrance and flavor.
